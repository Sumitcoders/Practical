#Beginners helping program...

print("Hello world..") # Print is used for executing..and for a string it must inside {""}..

#Back to the basics.. bois

# yeah bro Hastag is used for commenting out or for not running that specific code..


#beginners adding program.. with predefined terms..

x = 10
y = 12

m= x+y

print(m)


#beginners adding program with user given input..

x2 = int(input("1st no : "))
y2 = int(input("2nd no : "))

m2 = x2+y2

print(" The answer is : ",m2)

#Here int() function is used for getting input of inetegral terms only...
# And input() function is used for getting input from the user...
#Also you already know {""} are used to print string.. 
#String is a type because of which reading text can be printed / executed...


# Hope you will learn something from here...
